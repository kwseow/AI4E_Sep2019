"From one of our Senior Manager: 
•	Audric needs to first and foremost understand the intent of his work and how it contributes to the bigger picture, instead of taking work in as instructions. 

•	With that, it is important that he questions and clarifies – this is something that I have spoken about as when I was reviewing work, he literally copied and pasted without ask nor clarifying. 

•	I also had many challenges with his quality of work. The first round of AppSim review, I provided so many comments that I gave up and I decided to speak to him (and Wee Kian) myself. During then, I asked him multiple times to take notes to the point that I gave him the ultimatum that if he doesn’t take notes and the errors still occur, I would be very upset. He still did not but merely scribbled a few words. I spoke for an hour – he had 5 points and when I asked him to repeat what I had asked for, he clearly was not listening to me and could not do so. 

•	As expected the second round was peppered with comments – I think more than 50 comments for a 7 minute AppSim. I literally had to screenshot every other frame and tell him where he has gone wrong. He also ignored my email and basically did not reply to my comments personally."
